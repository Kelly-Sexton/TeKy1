As with last night’s assignment, remember to use the plethora of online resources to find an answer to an issue before reaching out for help. Remember the order:


1. Google & Stack Overflow
2. Fellow Students
3. TA or Instructor 


Submit the homework to your TA through slack. Make sure to put both your html and css file in the same folder and compress it before sending. To compress a folder simply two finger click (right click) and click compress.
